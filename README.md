## Minneapolis Crime Data Visualization For Year 2019-2024




Minneapolis is one of the cities in Minnesota with high crime rates, so I visualized Minneapolis' crime dataset from year 2019-2024, which I got from Minneapolis government's open data website; there were 284416 crimes recorded.


Where I visualized the first 1000 crime scenes of the dataset on a leaflet map with python.
